Squirrel is a high level imperative, object-oriented programming language, designed to be a light-weight scripting language that fits in the size, memory bandwidth, and real-time requirements of applications like video games. Although Squirrel offers a wide range of features like:
[square,options="compact"]
 * dynamic typing
 * delegation
 * classes & inheritance
 * higher order functions
 * lexical scoping
 * generators
 * cooperative threads(coroutines)
 * tail recursion
 * exception handling

Squirrel's syntax is similar to C/C++/Java etc... but the language has a very dynamic nature like Python/Lua etc...
