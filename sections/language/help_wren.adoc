Wren is a small, fast, class-based concurrent scripting language. Think Smalltalk in a Lua-sized package with a dash of Erlang and wrapped up in a familiar, modern https://wren.io/syntax.html[syntax].



 * *Wren is small*. The VM implementation is under 4,000 semicolons. You can skim the whole thing in an afternoon. Itâ€™s small, but not dense. It is readable and lovingly-commented.

 * *Wren is fast*. A fast single-pass compiler to tight bytecode, and a compact object representation help Wren compete with other dynamic languages.

 * *Wren is class-based*. There are lots of scripting languages out there, but many have unusual or non-existent object models. Wren places classes front and center.

 * *Wren is concurrent*. Lightweight fibers are core to the execution model and let you organize your program into a flock of communicating coroutines.

 * *Wren is a scripting language*. Wren is intended for embedding in applications. It has no dependencies, a small standard library, and an easy-to-use C API. It compiles cleanly as C99, C++98 or anything later.
