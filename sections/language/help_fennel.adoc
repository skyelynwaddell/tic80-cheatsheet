Fennel is a programming language that brings together the speed, simplicity, and reach of https://www.lua.org/[Lua] with the flexibility of a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)[lisp syntax and macro system].

 * *Full Lua compatibility*: Easily call any Lua function or library from Fennel and vice-versa.
 * *Zero overhead*: Compiled code should be just as efficient as hand-written Lua.
 * *Compile-time macros*: Ship compiled code with no runtime dependency on Fennel.
 * *Embeddable*: Fennel is a one-file library as well as an executable. Embed it in other programs to support runtime extensibility and interactive development.

Anywhere you can run Lua code, you can run Fennel code.
